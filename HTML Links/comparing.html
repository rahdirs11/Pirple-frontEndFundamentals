		<h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>Preparation for pizza recipe</h4>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Bring yeast, flour, sugar (or maple syrup) to room temperature.
						</li>
						<li>
							Firstly oour half cup luke warm water to a large mixing bowl. Dip your finger<br> in the water to check if it is just warm & not hot. Hot water will kill the yeast<br> and won't let the pizza dough rise.
						</li>
						<li>
							An ideal temperature of water is 40 to 43 C - 105 to 110 F. If you live in a very<br>cold place, just warm up your bowl first. Next pour warm water.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Proof yeast</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Add 1 teaspoon yeast (3 grams) to the warm water. You can use instant yeast<br>
						or active yeast. More details in the tips section below. If you prefer to go with<br>
						low yeast and let it rise slowly, then add only 1/3 teaspoon yeast (1 gram).
					</li>
					<li>
						Add 1 teaspoon raw sugar or maple syrup. Avoid using refined white sugar.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stir it gently. Allow this to rest undisturbed for 10 to 12 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						The mixture must turn frothy and bubbly. With instant yeast it won't turn very<br>
						frothy but will still froth to a minimum and you can see the yeast bubbling up.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you fail to get a frothy mixture, do not proceed further with this yeast. It is<br>
						inactive. So just discard this, Start again with fresh warm water, yeast and<br>
						sugar.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Make pizza dough</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When the yeast turns frothy, add 2½ cups flour (300 grams), ⅓ teaspoon salt<br>
						and 1½ tablespoon olive oil to the mixing bowl. Here I have used organic<br>
						unbleached all-purpose flour. You can also use 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1½<br>
						cup fine wheat flour.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mix all of them to form a dough. You will need more water (about 2 to 3 tbsps)<br>
						so add accordingly a little at a time until it forms a smooth and soft 
						<br>non-sticky dough. If the dough is sticky then you may sprinkle some flour.
					</li>
					<li>
						Knead the dough for 5 mins. Use the heel of your hand to press down the<br>
						dough against the kitchen counter/worktop and roll the pizza dough across.<br>
						Next fold it. Repeat this for a 4 to 5 minutes. At the end pizza dough should be<br>
						soft and when you poke it with your finger, it should dent and bounce back<br>
						slowly. This is the indication of the dough being ready.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Proofing dough</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Shape it to form a ball and apply a thin layer of oil to prevent the dough<br>
						from drying up. Also grease your bowl with some oil.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cover the bowl with a moist napkin or lid. Rest at room temperature until<br>
						the dough rises and doubles in size. An ideal temperature for rising dough is 26 C<br>
						(80 F) to 32 C (90 F).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Make pizza sauce</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To begin with puree 400 to 500 grams of tomatoes in a blender. Heat 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub><br>
						tablespoons oil in a pan and add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves (about a tablespoon).<br>
						Fry the garlic a bit until a nice aroma comes outfor a minute. Then<br>
						add 1 teaspoon red chilli flakes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pour the tomato puree Add <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon sugar. Give a<br>
						good stir.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cover the pot partially and simmer until the tomatoes cook down and<br>golden
						reduce to a thick consistency, Be careful at this stage as the puree splashes a<br>
						lot. Occasionally reduce the flame and give a good mix.
					</li>
					<li>
						When the mixture thickens to a sauce like consistency, add 1 teaspoon<br>
						Italian herbs and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon crushed pepper. Taste test this and add more<br>
						herbs, pepper or salt as needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						The consistency of the sauce has to be thick and of spreading consistency. It<br>
						should not be runny otherwise the pizza will be soggy and wet beneath the<br>
						cheese. Cool this completely and transfer to a jar if using it later.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Prepare veggies</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When you are ready to make pizza, prepare the veggies & grate the<br>
						cheese. WE prefer only onions, lots of bell peppers, mushrooms and olives. You<br>
						can use whatever veggies you prefer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep the veggies at room temperatures for a few hours so they don't let out<br>
						moisture on the pizza making it soggy. If using bottled olives drain them to a<br>
						small stainer.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
